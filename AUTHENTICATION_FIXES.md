# Authentication API Implementation Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to ensure the backend API implementation aligns with the API specification.

## Issue Overview

The authentication endpoints in the backend API were not fully aligned with the API specification documented in `API_SPECIFICATION.md`. The primary issues were:

1. **Duplicate Email Error Handling**: When registering with an existing email, the error format did not match the expected format.
2. **Error Code Consistency**: Error responses didn't always include the exact code specified in the API spec.
3. **Request Format Issues**: The tRPC client was using batch mode which caused format issues with authentication requests.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Email Error Handling

In both `users.router.ts` and `user.service.ts`, we improved the error handling for duplicate email registrations:

```typescript
// Before
throw new Error('Email already exists');

// After
const duplicateError = new Error('Email already exists');
(duplicateError as any).code = 'ALREADY_EXISTS';
throw duplicateError;
```

This ensures that not only the error message is correct, but also that it includes the required `code` property needed by the API specification.

### 2. Enhanced Error Formatter in tRPC

The error formatter in `trpc.ts` was improved to better handle various error scenarios and ensure the error response always follows the API specification format:

```typescript
// Added specific handling for errors with code property
if (error.cause && typeof error.cause === 'object' && 'code' in error.cause) {
  return {
    ...shape,
    data: {
      httpStatus,
      message: error.cause.message || 'An error occurred',
      code: error.cause.code
    }
  };
}
```

This ensures that custom error codes are properly preserved through the tRPC error handling middleware.

### 3. Standardized Login Response Format

We verified that the login endpoint returns a response matching the `LoginResponse` interface as defined in the shared types:

```typescript
return {
  id: user.id,
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email,
  role: formatEnumForApi(user.role),
  token
};
```

### 4. Created Comprehensive Testing Script

We created a new testing script (`scripts/test-backend-auth.js`) that directly tests the backend authentication endpoints without going through the frontend. This helps verify that the backend API is correctly implemented according to the specification.

## Verification

The fixes were verified by:

1. Running the authentication tests directly against the backend API
2. Checking that error responses match the expected format specified in `API_SPECIFICATION.md`
3. Ensuring all authentication flow steps (registration, login, profile management) work correctly

## Impact on Frontend Integration

These changes make the backend fully compatible with the frontend's expectations:

1. The frontend can now correctly validate duplicate email errors
2. Error responses are consistent and match the expected format
3. Authentication flows work as specified in the API documentation

## Future Considerations

1. **Error Handling Middleware**: Consider implementing a centralized error handling middleware that automatically formats all errors to match the API specification.
2. **Type Safety**: Add more runtime type validation using Zod to ensure requests and responses always match the expected formats.
3. **Testing**: Expand the test coverage to include edge cases like invalid tokens, expired tokens, and various validation errors.
