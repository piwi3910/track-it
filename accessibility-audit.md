# Accessibility Audit for Track-It

## Overview
This document outlines accessibility issues found during an audit of the Track-It application. The goal is to ensure compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards.

## Issues Identified

### Semantic HTML
- Many interactive elements use generic divs instead of semantic elements
- Missing heading hierarchy in some components
- Use of unstyled buttons for navigation instead of proper nav elements
- Missing main landmark in app layout

### ARIA Attributes
- Missing aria-labels on buttons with only icons
- Missing aria-expanded states on expandable components
- Missing aria-describedby for form fields with additional descriptions
- Missing role attributes on custom components
- Missing aria-current on active navigation items

### Keyboard Navigation
- Many interactive components are not properly focusable
- Task cards lack keyboard interaction support
- Menu components don't properly trap focus
- Modal dialogs don't trap focus
- Missing keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- No visible focus indicators on many interactive elements

### Color Contrast
- Some text has insufficient contrast against backgrounds
- Status indicators rely solely on color
- Interactive elements lack clear focus states

### Screen Reader Support
- Images missing alt text
- Complex components lack appropriate ARIA roles
- Interactive components don't announce state changes
- Form validation errors not properly announced

### Focus Management
- Modals don't properly manage focus (focus trap)
- No focus return when closing dialogs
- No skip links for keyboard navigation
- Long navigation flows without shortcuts

## Component-Specific Issues

### TaskCard Component
- Complex interactive card lacks proper keyboard support
- Click handlers on divs instead of buttons or links
- Insufficient labels for screen readers
- Interactive elements inside card don't receive focus properly
- Tooltips not accessible via keyboard

### TaskModal Component
- Form fields missing explicit labels
- Missing form validation error announcements
- Complex tabs navigation lacks proper ARIA roles
- Focus not trapped within modal
- Missing aria-labels for close buttons

### AppLayout
- Navigation items missing aria-current for active state
- Header actions missing proper labels
- Menu components not fully keyboard accessible

### DashboardPage
- Cards are clickable but not keyboard accessible
- Statistics lack context for screen readers
- Interactive elements without proper focus states

## Recommended Fixes

1. Add proper semantic HTML elements throughout the application
2. Implement ARIA attributes for all interactive components
3. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable
4. Improve color contrast and add non-color indicators
5. Add screen reader support through ARIA and proper element structure
6. Implement focus management for modals and complex components
7. Add skip links for keyboard navigation
8. Test all components with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation
