# Frontend-Backend Integration Plan

This document outlines the strategy for ensuring smooth integration between the frontend and backend of the Track-It application.

## Current Status

The project has a comprehensive API specification defined in `API_SPECIFICATION.md` and integration tests that verify the backend implementation matches this specification. Recent work has identified and fixed several misalignments between the API specification and the backend implementation.

## Remaining Issues

Based on test failures and code review, the following issues still need to be addressed:

### 1. Authentication Issues

The login flow is not working correctly. Specifically:

- **Login Request Format**: The frontend tests expect a login endpoint that accepts email and password, but the backend implementation might not be handling the request format correctly.
- **Registration Duplicate Check**: The backend does not properly reject registration attempts with duplicate emails.
- **Authentication Token Format**: The JWT token format or validation might be inconsistent between frontend and backend.

### 2. API Ping Endpoint

- The integration tests attempt to use a `users.ping` endpoint to verify backend connectivity, but this endpoint doesn't exist in the backend implementation.

### 3. Error Response Format Standardization

- Error responses need to be standardized across all endpoints to follow the format specified in the API documentation.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix Authentication Flow

1. Update `users.router.ts` to implement proper email uniqueness validation during registration
2. Ensure the login endpoint correctly validates credentials and returns JWT tokens in the expected format
3. Standardize user authentication formats between backend and frontend

### 2. Add Missing Endpoints

1. Implement the `users.ping` procedure for connectivity testing
2. Ensure all response formats match the API specification exactly

### 3. Testing Strategy

1. Use the existing integration tests to validate the fixes
2. Expand test coverage for edge cases in authentication flows
3. Add specific tests for error cases to ensure consistent error handling

## Benefits of Integration Testing

The comprehensive API tests provide several benefits:

1. **Contract Enforcement**: They ensure the backend adheres to the agreed-upon API specification
2. **Regression Prevention**: They catch when changes to the backend break the expected API contract
3. **Documentation Verification**: They validate that the API documentation remains accurate

## Next Steps

1. Fix the authentication issues as highest priority
2. Implement the missing ping endpoint
3. Run the integration test suite to verify fixes
4. Update any remaining endpoints that don't match the specification
5. Ensure error handling is consistent across all endpoints

By addressing these issues, we'll ensure a smooth integration between the frontend and backend components of the Track-It application and maintain a reliable API contract.
