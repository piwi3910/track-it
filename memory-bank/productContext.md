# Product Context: Track-It

## 1. Why This Project Exists

Track-It aims to provide a streamlined and integrated solution for task management and collaboration. Many existing tools may lack specific integrations (like Google Suite) or offer a user experience that doesn't fit all needs. This project intends to fill that gap by offering a user-friendly interface with essential views for different planning horizons.

- **Poor Long-Term Visibility:** Includes a calendar view for scheduling and visualizing tasks over extended periods.
- **Managing Future Work:** Features a backlog to capture and organize tasks that are not yet scheduled.
- **Collaboration Gaps:** (Future) Aims to facilitate collaboration around tasks.
- **Integration Needs:** Plans to integrate with Google Suite for enhanced productivity.
