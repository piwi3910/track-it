# Progress: Track-It (Frontend Scaffolding)

## 1. What Works / What Is Complete

**As of: 2025-05-09, 2:18 PM (Asia/Dubai)**

- **Memory Bank Initialization:**
    - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/productContext.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/techContext.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/progress.md`: Created and populated.
- **Initial Project Understanding:** Information from `CLAUDE.md` processed and integrated into the Memory Bank.
- **Frontend Directory Reset:**
    - Contents of `frontend/` directory deleted.
- **Frontend Project Scaffolding (Basic Shell):**
    - New Vite + React + TypeScript project initialized in `frontend/`.
    - Default npm dependencies installed.
    - Core project dependencies installed: `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/hooks`, `react-router-dom`, `zustand`, `@tanstack/react-query`.
    - Standard directory structure (`components`, `features`, etc.) created in `frontend/src/`.
    - `frontend/src/main.tsx` configured with `MantineProvider` (including theme and core styles) and `BrowserRouter`.
    - `frontend/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx` created with a basic `AppShell` (header, navbar, main content area with `Outlet`).
    - `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` created as a placeholder page.
    - `frontend/src/App.tsx` configured with basic routing for `AppLayout` and `DashboardPage`.

- **Frontend Project Configuration & Error Resolution:**
    - Configured path aliasing (`@` pointing to `src/`) in `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.app.json`.
    - Installed `@types/node` to resolve TypeScript errors in `vite.config.ts`.
    - Updated import paths in `TaskModal.tsx` and `DashboardPage.tsx` to use the `@` alias.
    - Addressed ESLint `any` warnings and used type-only imports where necessary.
    - Resolved "Failed to resolve import" and TypeScript errors for Mantine component props by simplifying `tsconfig.app.json` (removing `allowImportingTsExtensions`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `erasableSyntaxOnly`).
    - The development server (`npm run dev`) is now running without the previously encountered module resolution or TypeScript errors.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Next Steps

- **Frontend Application (Continuing Scaffolding & Initial Features):**
    - **Placeholder Pages:**
        - Create `frontend/src/pages/KanbanPage.tsx`.
        - Create `frontend/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx`.
        - Create `frontend/src/pages/BacklogPage.tsx`.
    - **Navigation:**
        - Add navigation links for Dashboard, Kanban, Calendar, and Backlog in `frontend/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx`.
        - Add corresponding routes in `frontend/src/App.tsx`.
    - **Dashboard UI (Basic):**
        - Start adding basic UI elements to `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` using Mantine components.
    - **State Management & Data Fetching Setup (Initial):**
        - Plan and potentially set up initial Zustand store structure if needed for global state.
        - Plan and potentially set up TanStack Query client (`QueryClientProvider`) in `main.tsx` or `App.tsx`.
    - **Mock Data & API:**
        - Create initial mock data structures in `frontend/src/api/mockData.ts`.
        - Create mock API functions in `frontend/src/api/mockApi.ts` to simulate data fetching for the dashboard.
- **Backend Application (Planned, Not Started):**
    - All backend components remain future work.

## 3. Current Status

- **Overall:** Project is in the early development phase. Memory Bank is established. The frontend has been reset, and a new basic application shell has been scaffolded.
- **Frontend:** A new, minimal Vite/React/TypeScript frontend is in place with basic structure, routing, Mantine setup, and path aliasing. The critical module resolution and TypeScript errors have been resolved.
- **Backend:** Not started.
- **Documentation:** Memory Bank is up-to-date with the latest scaffolding progress and error resolution steps.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **None currently.** The previous "Failed to resolve import" and TypeScript errors for Mantine props have been resolved.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **[2025-05-09] Decision:** User instructed to delete the existing frontend and start from scratch due to unfixable issues. This supersedes any previous attempts to modify or debug the old frontend. (No change)
- **[2025-05-09] Decision:** Memory Bank initialization is the first step before any code modification or creation, following custom instructions. (No change)
- **[2025-05-09] Frontend Scaffolding:** Proceeded with creating a new Vite project, installing dependencies, setting up directory structure, and implementing a basic app shell with routing and Mantine.
- **[2025-05-09] Error Resolution:** Addressed persistent module resolution and TypeScript errors by implementing path aliasing and simplifying `tsconfig.app.json`. This highlights that overly strict or newer TypeScript module settings can sometimes conflict with Vite/library type inference.
- **[2025-05-21] Documentation Update:** Added detailed development process rules to systemPatterns.md, establishing a clear workflow for future development that follows best practices for frontend-backend integration.
