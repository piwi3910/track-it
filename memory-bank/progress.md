# Progress: Track-It (Frontend Development)

## 1. What Works / What Is Complete

**As of: 2025-05-22, 10:59 AM (Asia/Dubai)**

- **Memory Bank Initialization:**
    - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/productContext.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/techContext.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Created and populated.
    - `memory-bank/progress.md`: Created and populated.
- **Initial Project Understanding:** Information from `CLAUDE.md` processed and integrated into the Memory Bank.
- **Frontend Directory Reset:**
    - Contents of `frontend/` directory deleted.
- **Frontend Project Scaffolding (Basic Shell):**
    - New Vite + React + TypeScript project initialized in `frontend/`.
    - Default npm dependencies installed.
    - Core project dependencies installed: `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/hooks`, `react-router-dom`, `zustand`, `@tanstack/react-query`.
    - Standard directory structure (`components`, `features`, etc.) created in `frontend/src/`.
    - `frontend/src/main.tsx` configured with `MantineProvider` (including theme and core styles) and `BrowserRouter`.
    - `frontend/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx` created with a basic `AppShell` (header, navbar, main content area with `Outlet`).
    - `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` created as a placeholder page.
    - `frontend/src/App.tsx` configured with basic routing for `AppLayout` and `DashboardPage`.

- **Frontend Project Configuration & Error Resolution:**
    - Configured path aliasing (`@` pointing to `src/`) in `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.app.json`.
    - Installed `@types/node` to resolve TypeScript errors in `vite.config.ts`.
    - Updated import paths in `TaskModal.tsx` and `DashboardPage.tsx` to use the `@` alias.
    - Addressed ESLint `any` warnings and used type-only imports where necessary.
    - Resolved "Failed to resolve import" and TypeScript errors for Mantine component props by simplifying `tsconfig.app.json` (removing `allowImportingTsExtensions`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `erasableSyntaxOnly`).
    - The development server (`npm run dev`) is now running without the previously encountered module resolution or TypeScript errors.

- **Core Frontend Features Implemented:**
    - **Complete Page Structure:**
        - Created all main page components: `DashboardPage.tsx`, `KanbanPage.tsx`, `CalendarPage.tsx`, `BacklogPage.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`, `TemplatesPage.tsx`, and `LoginPage.tsx`.
        - Implemented routing for all pages in `App.tsx` with protected routes.
    - **Navigation & Layout:**
        - Enhanced `AppLayout.tsx` with a full navigation sidebar, header with user menu, theme toggle, and global search.
        - Added notification menu component in the header.
        - Implemented responsive design with mobile navigation support.
    - **Dashboard UI:**
        - Built a comprehensive dashboard with statistics cards showing task counts and completion percentage.
        - Added task lists grouped by status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
        - Implemented quick add task functionality.
    - **Task Management:**
        - Created a detailed `TaskModal.tsx` component for creating and editing tasks.
        - Implemented support for task properties: title, description, status, priority, due date, tags, assignee.
        - Added advanced features: subtasks with completion tracking, multi-day tasks, time tracking (estimated vs. actual hours).
        - Implemented recurrence patterns for repeating tasks.
        - Added task conversation/comments functionality.
        - Created template saving functionality for reusable task templates.
    - **Authentication:**
        - Implemented `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component for securing routes.
        - Added `AuthErrorHandler.tsx` for global authentication error handling.
        - Created login page and authentication flow.
    - **State Management & API Integration:**
        - Set up Zustand stores for various concerns (auth, tasks, notifications, etc.).
        - Configured TanStack Query client for data fetching.
        - Set up tRPC client for type-safe API communication.
        - Added context providers for global state and functionality.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Next Steps

- **Frontend Application (Continuing Development):**
    - **Kanban Board:**
        - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between columns.
        - Add filtering and sorting options.
    - **Calendar View:**
        - Implement month/week/day views.
        - Add task creation directly from calendar.
        - Handle recurring tasks display.
    - **Backlog Management:**
        - Implement prioritization and filtering.
        - Add batch operations for multiple tasks.
    - **Templates Feature:**
        - Complete the templates management page.
        - Implement template application to create new tasks.
    - **Settings Page:**
        - Add user profile settings.
        - Implement notification preferences.
        - Add theme customization options.
    - **API Integration:**
        - Connect all frontend components to the backend API.
        - Implement proper error handling and loading states.
        - Add offline support and data synchronization.
    - **Testing:**
        - Add unit tests for key components.
        - Implement integration tests for critical user flows.
- **Backend Application (Planned, Not Started):**
    - All backend components remain future work.

## 3. Current Status

- **Overall:** Project has progressed from basic scaffolding to a functional frontend application with comprehensive task management features.
- **Frontend:** A feature-rich React/TypeScript frontend is in place with advanced UI components, state management, and mock data integration. The application has a complete task management interface with various views and features.
- **Backend:** Not started.
- **Documentation:** Memory Bank is being updated to reflect the current state of the project.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **TypeScript Type Checking:** Some components are using `@ts-nocheck` to temporarily disable type checking. These will need proper typing in the future.
- **Mock Data Integration:** Currently using mock data for development. Will need to be replaced with real API calls.
- **Authentication Flow:** Authentication is implemented but needs to be connected to a real backend.
- **Testing Coverage:** No automated tests have been implemented yet.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **[2025-05-09] Decision:** User instructed to delete the existing frontend and start from scratch due to unfixable issues. This supersedes any previous attempts to modify or debug the old frontend.
- **[2025-05-09] Decision:** Memory Bank initialization is the first step before any code modification or creation, following custom instructions.
- **[2025-05-09] Frontend Scaffolding:** Proceeded with creating a new Vite project, installing dependencies, setting up directory structure, and implementing a basic app shell with routing and Mantine.
- **[2025-05-09] Error Resolution:** Addressed persistent module resolution and TypeScript errors by implementing path aliasing and simplifying `tsconfig.app.json`. This highlights that overly strict or newer TypeScript module settings can sometimes conflict with Vite/library type inference.
- **[2025-05-21] Documentation Update:** Added detailed development process rules to systemPatterns.md, establishing a clear workflow for future development that follows best practices for frontend-backend integration.
- **[2025-05-22] Frontend Development:** Significant progress made on frontend implementation with comprehensive task management features, UI components, and state management. The application now has a functional user interface with mock data integration.
- **[2025-05-22 11:01:36] Memory Bank Update:** Updated all memory bank files to reflect the current state of the project after manual coding sessions. This includes documenting the implemented frontend features, UI components, state management, and architectural patterns.
[2025-05-22 11:34:09] - Completed unit test coverage for `frontend/src/utils/api-utils.ts` including `combineResponses` and `isApiAvailable` functions. Fixed Jest configuration for `import.meta.env` mocking.
