# Project Brief: Track-It

## 1. Core Requirements & Goals

Track-It is a task tracking and collaboration application designed to integrate with Google Suite. The primary goal is to provide users with a comprehensive platform to manage their tasks effectively through various views and planning tools.

Key features include:
- A **Dashboard** for a high-level overview of tasks and project status.
- A **Kanban-style board** for weekly task planning and progress tracking.
- A **Calendar view** for long-term planning and scheduling of tasks.
- A **Backlog tracking system** for managing unscheduled items and future tasks.

## 2. Project Scope

The project encompasses the development of both frontend and backend components.

**Frontend:**
- User interface for all features listed above.
- Interaction with mock data initially, with a plan to integrate with a live backend via tRPC.
- Responsive design for usability across different devices (assumption, to be confirmed).

**Backend (Planned):**
- API services to support all frontend functionalities.
- Database for persistent storage of tasks, user data, and other relevant information.
- Caching mechanisms for performance optimization.
- Secure and type-safe API endpoints using tRPC.

## 3. Target Users
